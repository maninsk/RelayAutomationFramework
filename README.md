Automation Framework :
  I have designed this framework with basic structure to give a idea about Api automation and same has been integrated with Azure devOps pileline for continous integration.
  Test execution used Nunit runner for simplification.
  Some test cases written in feature file to give a idea on BDD approach and remaining given in email.
  

Langugage : C#

Technology & Tools : .Netcore,C#,Nunit,Restshap tools,Specflow runner,Azure DeOps

Step to Run the tests:
  Clone the repo -> Build the project -> Go to Test Explorer - >Run the tests
  
Branch Strategy : 
Feature branch -> raise pull request -> Build validation - >Merge to Main

Framework development approach : Data Model,BDD and Hybrid approach
